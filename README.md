📈 AI for Predicting Stock Prices using LSTM

This project builds an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to predict stock prices using historical stock market data. The model is trained on Tesla (TSLA) stock data from Yahoo Finance and aims to predict future closing prices based on past trends.

🚀 Features

✅ Fetches real-time stock market data using Yahoo Finance (yfinance)

✅ Preprocesses and scales data using MinMaxScaler

✅ Constructs sequences of past stock prices for LSTM training

✅ Implements an LSTM-based deep learning model for time series forecasting

✅ Evaluates performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE)

✅ Visualizes actual vs. predicted prices using Matplotlib & Seaborn

📊 Technologies Used

Python 🐍

TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning)

Scikit-Learn (Preprocessing & Evaluation)

Yahoo Finance API (Stock Data)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

🔧 How to Run

1️⃣ Clone this repository:
